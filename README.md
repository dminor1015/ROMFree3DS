# ROMFree3DS
freeShop for the 3DS, but rewritten.

## What is ROMFree3DS?
ROMFree3DS is an free rewrite of freeShop as it got patched.
Right now it's only available in .3dsx format, but by the time I'll make the first release it'll also be available in .cia format.
First Dontwait00 was also helping writing this tool, but he stopped with it as I stopped uploading new games for a while.
